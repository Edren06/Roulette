# Roulette
This application has been created with Entity Framework and connects to a sql lite database. I have used dependency inject to inject the data context and the roulette service so that it is accessable to the application. Since there are finite options I have mapped the payout ratios in the SQL LITE database. There is also a UNIT Testing project that you can use to check the tests.

The application has been built in .net 6 and swagger can be used to test the app, the API calls are as follows:

PlaceBet (Accepts an amount and the name of the location you would want to bet) - various names are as follows and accepted as strings with their payout ratios, I have unfortunately omitted the doubles
and square bets due to time constraints:
